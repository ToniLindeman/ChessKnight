This is a small programming exercise project.
In this program the user:
	1) Picks a target position on the chestboard.
	2) Picks a starting position for the knight.

After these steps the program calculates the optimum path from the knights starting position to the target position.
There are a few options like setting the boardsize. Larger boardsizes require more time to calculate the moves.
